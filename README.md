## Personnality Celebrity Classification
This project focuses on solving the problem of personality celebrity detection using machine learning techniques. The goal is to accurately classify images of individuals and determine whether they resemble a particular celebrity or not. This README file provides an overview of the project, its features, dependencies, and instructions on how to use and reproduce the results.
* Personality Celebrity Detection is a machine learning problem that aims to classify images of individuals and determine if they resemble a specific celebrity or not. The project utilizes various classification algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and logistic regression, to achieve accurate predictions. In addition, it incorporates feature engineering techniques, including wavelet transform from OpenCV and Haarcascades for eyes and face detection.

## Features
The project offers the following features:

* Training and evaluation of machine learning models for personality celebrity detection.
* Image preprocessing and feature extraction.
* Feature engineering techniques utilized: wavelet transform and Haarcascades.
* Sample dataset for training and testing.
* Model Building:  Classification algorithms implemented SVM logistic regression, Random Forest and xgboost.
* Model evaluation for model performance with GridSearch
